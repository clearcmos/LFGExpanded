# LFGExpanded

**LFG Expanded** adds a filter side panel to the LFG Browse frame, letting you filter search results by role and class.

Built specifically for **TBC Classic Anniversary**.

---

## Features

- **Role filters** - Tank, Healer, DPS toggle icons with include/exclude
- **Class filters** - All 9 TBC classes with class-colored labels, include/exclude
- **Per-class role breakdown** - Each class row shows how many listings have that class as Tank, Healer, or DPS with native Group Browser icons
- **Class notes tooltips** - Hover the info icon on any class to see listing notes from leaders of that class, with class-colored names
- **Include/Exclude** - Left-click to require, right-click to exclude, click again to clear
- **Smart exclusion** - Groups: reject if excluded role/class is present. Singles: reject only if all listed roles are excluded (a healer+dps passes a healer exclusion)
- **Gear menu options** - Show/hide groups, singles, or level 70 only via gear dropdown
- **Smart sorting** - Groups shown first, singles sorted by class when filters active
- **Search Again & Reset** - Buttons to re-search or clear all filters
- **Native LFG styling** - Uses the same portrait frame, background textures, and tab style as the built-in Group Finder
